## 🎯 Note on Python Usage

**Recommended Workflow: Use Your Existing Virtual Environment**
If you completed the Tech Setup Challenge Part 2, you already have a virtual environment set up! Here's how to use it for this new challenge:

1. **Clone this new challenge repository** (see Getting Started section below)
2. **Open the cloned repository in Cursor**
3. **Set this project to use your existing Python interpreter:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Python: Select Interpreter"
   - Navigate to and choose the interpreter from your existing virtual environment (e.g., `your-previous-project/venv/Scripts/python.exe`)
4. **Activate the environment in your terminal:**
   - Open terminal in Cursor (`Ctrl + ``)
   - Navigate to your previous project folder where you have the `venv` folder
   - **💡 Pro tip:** You can quickly navigate by typing `cd` followed by dragging the folder from your file explorer into the terminal
   - Activate using the appropriate command for your system:
     - **Windows Command Prompt:** `venv\Scripts\activate`
     - **Windows PowerShell:** `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
     - **Mac/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
   - You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt
5. **Install additional packages if needed:** `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Cloud Storage Warning

**Avoid using Google Drive, OneDrive, or other cloud storage for Python projects!** These services can cause issues with:
- Package installations failing due to file locking
- Virtual environment corruption
- Slow performance during pip operations

**Best practice:** Keep your Python projects in a local folder like `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\` or `~/Documents/` instead of cloud-synced folders.
:::

**Alternative: Create a New Virtual Environment**
If you prefer a fresh environment, follow the Quarto documentation: [https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html). Be sure to follow the instructions to activate the environment, set it up as your default Python interpreter for the project, and install the necessary packages (e.g. pandas) for this challenge.  For installing the packages, you can use the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command since you already have the requirements.txt file in your project.   Some steps do take a bit of time, so be patient.

**Why This Works:** Virtual environments are portable - you can use the same environment across multiple projects, and Cursor automatically activates it when you select the interpreter!

## The Problem: Mastering Data Manipulation Through Method Chaining

**Core Question:** How can we efficiently manipulate datasets using `pandas` method chaining to answer complex business questions?

**The Challenge:** Real-world data analysis requires combining multiple data manipulation techniques in sequence. Rather than creating intermediate variables at each step, method chaining allows us to write clean, readable code that flows logically from one operation to the next.

**Our Approach:** We'll work with ZappTech's shipment data to answer critical business questions about service levels and cross-category orders, using the seven mental models of data manipulation through pandas method chaining.

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance → Awareness → Learning → Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.
:::

## The Seven Mental Models of Data Manipulation

The seven most important ways we manipulate datasets are:

1. **Assign:** Add new variables with calculations and transformations
2. **Subset:** Filter data based on conditions or select specific columns
3. **Drop:** Remove unwanted variables or observations
4. **Sort:** Arrange data by values or indices
5. **Aggregate:** Summarize data using functions like mean, sum, count
6. **Merge:** Combine information from multiple datasets
7. **Split-Apply-Combine:** Group data and apply functions within groups


## Data and Business Context

We analyze ZappTech's shipment data, which contains information about product deliveries across multiple categories. This dataset is ideal for our analysis because:

- **Real Business Questions:** CEO wants to understand service levels and cross-category shopping patterns
- **Multiple Data Sources:** Requires merging shipment data with product category information
- **Complex Relationships:** Service levels may vary by product category, and customers may order across categories
- **Method Chaining Practice:** Perfect for demonstrating all seven mental models in sequence

## Data Loading and Initial Exploration

Let's start by loading the ZappTech shipment data and understanding what we're working with.

```{python}
#| label: load-data
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Load the shipment data
shipments_df = pd.read_csv(
    "shipments.csv", 
    parse_dates=['plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate']
)

# Load product line data
product_line_df = pd.read_csv(
    "productLine.csv"
)

# Reduce dataset size for faster processing (4,000 rows instead of 96,805 rows)
shipments_df = shipments_df.head(4000)

print("Shipments data shape:", shipments_df.shape)
print("\nShipments data columns:", shipments_df.columns.tolist())
print("\nFirst few rows of shipments data:")
print(shipments_df.head(10))

print("\n" + "="*50)
print("Product line data shape:", product_line_df.shape)
print("\nProduct line data columns:", product_line_df.columns.tolist())
print("\nFirst few rows of product line data:")
print(product_line_df.head(10))
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 Understanding the Data

**Shipments Data:** Contains individual line items for each shipment, including:
- `shipID`: Unique identifier for each shipment
- `partID`: Product identifier
- `plannedShipDate`: When the shipment was supposed to go out
- `actualShipDate`: When it actually shipped
- `quantity`: How many units were shipped

**Product Category and Line Data:** Contains product category information:
- `partID`: Links to shipments data
- `productLine`: The category each product belongs to
- `prodCategory`: The category each product belongs to

**Business Questions We'll Answer:**
1. Does service level (on-time shipments) vary across product categories?
2. How often do orders include products from more than one category?
:::

## The Seven Mental Models: A Progressive Learning Journey

Now we'll work through each of the seven mental models using method chaining, starting simple and building complexity.

### 1. Assign: Adding New Variables

**Mental Model:** Create new columns with calculations and transformations.

Let's start by calculating whether each shipment was late:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-1-assign
#| echo: true

# Simple assignment - calculate if shipment was late
shipments_with_lateness = (
    shipments_df
    .assign(
        is_late=lambda df: df['actualShipDate'] > df['plannedShipDate'],
        days_late=lambda df: (df['actualShipDate'] - df['plannedShipDate']).dt.days
    )
)

print("Added lateness calculations:")
print(shipments_with_lateness[['shipID', 'plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate', 'is_late', 'days_late']].head())
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Method Chaining Tip for New Python Users

**Why use `lambda df:`?** When chaining methods, we need to reference the current state of the dataframe. The `lambda df:` tells pandas "use the current dataframe in this calculation." Without it, pandas would look for a variable called `df` that doesn't exist.

**Alternative approach:** You could also write this as separate steps, but method chaining keeps related operations together and makes the code more readable.
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Assign Mental Model

**Question 1: Data Types and Date Handling**
- What is the `dtype` of the `actualShipDate` series? How can you find out using code?
- Why is it important that both `actualShipDate` and `plannedShipDate` have the same data type for comparison?

**Question 2: String vs Date Comparison**
- Can you give an example where comparing two dates as strings would yield unintuitive results, e.g. what happens if you try to compare "04-11-2025" and "05-20-2024" as strings vs as dates?

**Question 3: Debug This Code**
```python
# This code has an error - can you spot it?
shipments_with_lateness = (
    shipments_df
    .assign(
        is_late=lambda df: df['actualShipDate'] > df['plannedShipDate'],
        days_late=lambda df: (df['actualShipDate'] - df['plannedShipDate']).dt.days,
        lateStatement="Darn Shipment is Late" if shipments_df['is_late'] else "Shipment is on Time"
    )
)
```
What's wrong with the `lateStatement` assignment and how would you fix it?
:::

#### Briefly Give Answers to the Discussion Questions In This Section
::: {.callout-tip}
## Section 1 Answers:
**Answer 1: Data Types and Date Handling**
The dtype of the actualShipDate series is datetime64[ns].
This can be found by using the .dtype method on the actualShipDate column.
```{python}
print("The dtype of the actualShipDate series is:", shipments_df['actualShipDate'].dtype)
```

**Answer 2: String vs Date Comparison**
Comparing dates as strings can lead to errors.
This happens because strings are compared lexicographically (character by character), while date objects are compared chronologically.
Specifically, "20" comes before "21" in lexicographic order.

```{python}
print("Comparing '10-21-2024' and '10-20-2025' as strings, which is false, but returned", "10-21-2024" > "10-20-2025")
print("Comparing '10-21-2024' and '10-20-2025' as dates, False is correct and returned:", pd.to_datetime("10-21-2024") > pd.to_datetime("10-20-2025"))

```
**Answer 3: Debug This Code**
The error occurs because the lambda inside .assign() isn't vectorized and won't work with conditional statements like if/else. We can't directly use a conditional statement like that in a vectorized assignment.

To fix it, we should use .map() to create a new column with the lateStatement values and use lambda df: to reference the current dataframe.
```{python}
shipments_with_lateness = (
    shipments_df
    .assign(
        is_late=lambda df: df['actualShipDate'] > df['plannedShipDate'],
        days_late=lambda df: (df['actualShipDate'] - df['plannedShipDate']).dt.days,
         lateStatement=lambda df: df['is_late'].map({True: "Darn Shipment is Late", False: "Shipment is on Time"})
    )
)
```
:::
### 2. Subset: Querying Rows and Filtering Columns

**Mental Model:** Query rows based on conditions and filter to keep specific columns.

Let's query for only late shipments and filter to keep the columns we need:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-2-subset
#| echo: true

# Query rows for late shipments and filter to keep specific columns
late_shipments = (
    shipments_with_lateness
    .query('is_late == True')  # Query rows where is_late is True
    .filter(['shipID', 'partID', 'plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate', 'days_late'])  # Filter to keep specific columns
)

print(f"Found {len(late_shipments)} late shipments out of {len(shipments_with_lateness)} total")
print("\nLate shipments sample:")
print(late_shipments.head())
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 🔍 Understanding the Methods

- **`.query()`**: Query rows based on conditions (like SQL WHERE clause)
- **`.filter()`**: Filter to keep specific columns by name
- **Alternative**: You could use `.loc[]` for more complex row querying, but `.query()` is often more readable
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Subset Mental Model

**Question 1: Query vs Boolean Indexing**
- What's the difference between using `.query('is_late == True')` and `[df['is_late'] == True]`?
- Which approach is more readable and why?

**Question 2: Additional Row Querying**
- Can you show an example of using a variable like `late_threshold` to query rows for shipments that are at least `late_threshold` days late, e.g. what if you wanted to query rows for shipments that are at least 5 days late?
:::

#### Briefly Give Answers to the Discussion Questions In This Section

::: {.callout-tip} 
## Section 2 Answers:
**Answer 1: Query vs Boolean Indexing**
The difference is that .query() allows you to filter data with a SQL-like syntax, whereas boolean indexing uses logical conditions directly on the dataframe.
.query() is more readable and easier to understand due to its SQL-like syntax, especially for complex queries.

**Answer 2: Additional Row Querying**
You can use a variable like `late_threshold` to query rows for shipments that are at least `late_threshold` days late.
For example, if you wanted to query rows for shipments that are at least 5 days late, you could use the following code:
```{python}
late_shipments = shipments_with_lateness.query('days_late >= 5')
print(late_shipments.head())
print(f"Found {len(late_shipments)} late shipments out of {len(shipments_with_lateness)} total")
```
:::

### 3. Drop: Removing Unwanted Data

**Mental Model:** Remove columns or rows you don't need.

Let's clean up our data by removing unnecessary columns:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-3-drop
#| echo: true

# Create a cleaner dataset by dropping unnecessary columns
clean_shipments = (
    shipments_with_lateness
    .drop(columns=['quantity'])  # Drop quantity column (not needed for our analysis)
    .dropna(subset=['plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate'])  # Remove rows with missing dates
)

print(f"Cleaned dataset: {len(clean_shipments)} rows, {len(clean_shipments.columns)} columns")
print("Remaining columns:", clean_shipments.columns.tolist())
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Drop Mental Model

**Question 1: Drop vs Filter Strategies**
- What's the difference between `.drop(columns=['quantity'])` and `.filter()` with a list of columns you want to keep?
- When would you choose to drop columns vs filter to keep specific columns?

**Question 2: Handling Missing Data**
- What happens if you use `.dropna()` without specifying `subset`? How is this different from `.dropna(subset=['plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate'])`?
- Why might you want to be selective about which columns to check for missing values?

:::

#### Briefly Give Answers to the Discussion Questions In This Section

::: {.callout-tip}
## Section 3 Answers:

**Answer 1: Drop vs Filter Strategies**
The difference between `.drop(columns=['quantity'])` and `.filter()` with a list of columns you want to keep is that `.drop(columns=['quantity'])` removes the quantity column from the dataframe, while `.filter()` keeps the quantity column in the dataframe.
You would choose to drop columns if you don't need them for your analysis, and filter columns if you need to keep them for your analysis and use the filter() method to keep the columns you need.

**Answer 2: Handling Missing Data**
If we use `.dropna()` without specifying `subset`, it will remove any rows that have missing values in any column.
This is different from `.dropna(subset=['plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate'])` because it will only remove rows that have missing values in the plannedShipDate or actualShipDate columns.
We would want to be selective about which columns to check for missing values if we have a lot of columns and only a few of them are missing values and we don't want to lose too much data.
:::

### 4. Sort: Arranging Data

**Mental Model:** Order data by values or indices.

Let's sort by lateness to see the worst offenders:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-4-sort
#| echo: true

# Sort by days late (worst first)
sorted_by_lateness = (
    clean_shipments
    .sort_values('days_late', ascending=False)  # Sort by days_late, highest first
    .reset_index(drop=True)  # Reset index to be sequential
)

print("Shipments sorted by lateness (worst first):")
print(sorted_by_lateness[['shipID', 'partID', 'days_late', 'is_late']].head(10))
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Sort Mental Model

**Question 1: Sorting Strategies**
- What's the difference between `ascending=False` and `ascending=True` in sorting?
- How would you sort by multiple columns (e.g., first by `is_late`, then by `days_late`)?

**Question 2: Index Management**
- Why do we use `.reset_index(drop=True)` after sorting?
- What happens to the original index when you sort? Why might this be problematic?

:::

#### Briefly Give Answers to the Discussion Questions In This Section

::: {.callout-tip}
## Section 4 Answers:

**Answer 1: Sorting Strategies**
The difference between `ascending=False` and `ascending=True` in sorting is that `ascending=False` sorts the data in descending order, while `ascending=True` sorts the data in ascending order.
You would use `ascending=False` if you want to sort the data from highest to lowest, and `ascending=True` if you want to sort the data from lowest to highest.
To sort by multiple columns, we can use the `by` parameter with a list of columns. Below code sorts the data by `is_late` first, then by `days_late`.
```{python}
sorted_by_lateness = clean_shipments.sort_values(by=['is_late', 'days_late'], ascending=[False, True])
print(sorted_by_lateness.head(10))
```

**Answer 2: Index Management**
- We use `.reset_index(drop=True)` after sorting to reset the index of the dataframe to be sequential (0, 1, 2, 3...).
After sorting, the index becomes non-sequential (e.g., rows might have index values like 150, 23, 489, 7...), which can be confusing when trying to access rows by position using `.iloc`.
The `drop=True` parameter tells pandas to drop the old index (not keep it as a column). reset_index(drop=True) → reassigns fresh 0-based indices and discards the old ones.
- When you sort a DataFrame, the rows are reordered but keep their original index values, making the index non-sequential.
This can be confusing or problematic when accessing rows by position or aligning DataFrames.
:::
### 5. Aggregate: Summarizing Data

**Mental Model:** Calculate summary statistics across groups or the entire dataset.

Let's calculate overall service level metrics:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-5-aggregate
#| echo: true

# Calculate overall service level metrics
service_metrics = (
    clean_shipments
    .agg({
        'is_late': ['count', 'sum', 'mean'],  # Count total, count late, calculate percentage
        'days_late': ['mean', 'max']  # Average and maximum days late
    })
    .round(3)
)

print("Overall Service Level Metrics:")
print(service_metrics)

# Calculate percentage on-time directly from the data
on_time_rate = (1 - clean_shipments['is_late'].mean()) * 100
print(f"\nOn-time delivery rate: {on_time_rate:.1f}%")
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Aggregate Mental Model

**Question 1: Boolean Aggregation**
- Why does `sum()` work on boolean values? What does it count?

:::

#### Briefly Give Answers to the Discussion Questions In This Section

::: {.callout-tip}
## Section 5 Answers:
**Answer 1: Boolean Aggregation**
The `sum()` function works on boolean values because it counts the number of True values in the series.
For example, if we have a series of boolean values [True, False, True, True, False], the sum() function will return 3 because there are 3 True values.
:::

### 6. Merge: Combining Information

**Mental Model:** Join data from multiple sources to create richer datasets.

Now let's analyze service levels by product category. First, we need to merge our data:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-6-merge-prep
#| echo: true

# Merge shipment data with product line data
shipments_with_category = (
    clean_shipments
    .merge(product_line_df, on='partID', how='left')  # Left join to keep all shipments
    .assign(
        category_late=lambda df: df['is_late'] & df['prodCategory'].notna()  # Only count as late if we have category info
    )
)

print("\nProduct categories available:")
print(shipments_with_category['prodCategory'].value_counts())
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Merge Mental Model

**Question 1: Join Types and Data Loss**
- Why does your professor think we should use `how='left'` in most cases? 
- How can you check if any shipments were lost during the merge?

**Question 2: Key Column Matching**
- What happens if there are duplicate `partID` values in the `product_line_df`?

:::

#### Briefly Give Answers to the Discussion Questions In This Section

::: {.callout-tip}
## Section 6 Answers:      

**Answer 1: Join Types and Data Loss**
We use how='left' because it keeps all rows from the left DataFrame (shipments_df) even if some don’t have a match in the right DataFrame (product_line_df).
This ensures that no shipments are lost due to missing product information.
To check if any shipments were lost, we can compare the row counts before and after the merge, or check for missing values in the joined columns. If the row counts are the same, no shipments were lost during the merge.
```{python}
print(f"Rows before merge: {len(clean_shipments)}")
print(f"Rows after merge: {len(shipments_with_category)}")
print(f"Rows lost: {len(clean_shipments) - len(shipments_with_category)}")
```

**Answer 2: Key Column Matching**
If there are duplicate partID values in product_line_df, the merge creates a one-to-many relationship — meaning the matching shipment rows will be duplicated for each matching partID in product_line_df.
So instead of losing data, you may end up with extra rows in the merged DataFrame.
:::
### 7. Split-Apply-Combine: Group Analysis

**Mental Model:** Group data and apply functions within each group.

Now let's analyze service levels by category:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-7-groupby
#| echo: true

# Analyze service levels by product category
service_by_category = (
    shipments_with_category
    .groupby('prodCategory')  # Split by product category
    .agg({
        'is_late': ['any', 'count', 'sum', 'mean'],  # Count, late count, percentage late
        'days_late': ['mean', 'max']  # Average and max days late
    })
    .round(3)
)

print("Service Level by Product Category:")
print(service_by_category)
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Split-Apply-Combine Mental Model

**Question 1: GroupBy Mechanics**
- What does `.groupby('prodCategory')` actually do? How does it "split" the data?
- Why do we need to use `.agg()` after grouping? What happens if you don't?

**Question 2: Multi-Level Grouping**
- Explore grouping by `['shipID', 'prodCategory']`?  What question does this answer versus grouping by `'prodCategory'` alone?  (HINT: There may be many rows with identical shipID's due to a particular order having multiple partID's.)
:::

#### Briefly Give Answers to the Discussion Questions In This Section

::: {.callout-tip}
## Section 7 Answers:

**Answer 1: GroupBy Mechanics**
The .groupby('prodCategory') splits the DataFrame into separate groups based on each unique value in the prodCategory column.
Each group contains only the rows that share the same prodCategory, allowing you to perform calculations or summaries within each category independently.
We use .agg() after grouping to apply aggregation functions (like sum, mean, or count) to each group and produce a summarized result.
If you don’t use .agg() (or another aggregation method like .mean()), you’ll just have a GroupBy object, not a summarized DataFrame — meaning no calculations are actually performed yet.


**Answer 2: Multi-Level Grouping**
Grouping by ['shipID', 'prodCategory'] answers the question of which categories are late for each shipment.
Grouping by 'prodCategory' alone answers the question of which categories are late overall.
:::
## Answering A Business Question

**Mental Model:** Combine multiple data manipulation techniques to answer complex business questions.

Let's create a comprehensive analysis by combining shipment-level data with category information:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-7-comprehensive
#| echo: true

# Create a comprehensive analysis dataset
comprehensive_analysis = (
    shipments_with_category
    .groupby(['shipID', 'prodCategory'])  # Group by shipment and category
    .agg({
        'is_late': 'any',  # True if any item in this shipment/category is late
        'days_late': 'max'  # Maximum days late for this shipment/category
    })
    .reset_index()
    .assign(
        has_multiple_categories=lambda df: df.groupby('shipID')['prodCategory'].transform('nunique') > 1
    )
)

print("Comprehensive analysis - shipments with multiple categories:")
multi_category_shipments = comprehensive_analysis[comprehensive_analysis['has_multiple_categories']]
print(f"Shipments with multiple categories: {multi_category_shipments['shipID'].nunique()}")
print(f"Total unique shipments: {comprehensive_analysis['shipID'].nunique()}")
print(f"Percentage with multiple categories: {multi_category_shipments['shipID'].nunique() / comprehensive_analysis['shipID'].nunique() * 100:.1f}%")
```

## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Answering A Business Question

**Question 1: Business Question Analysis**
- What business question does this comprehensive analysis answer?
- How does grouping by `['shipID', 'prodCategory']` differ from grouping by just `'prodCategory'`?
- What insights can ZappTech's management gain from knowing the percentage of multi-category shipments?
:::

#### Briefly Give Answers to the Discussion Questions In This Section

::: {.callout-tip}
## Section 8 Answers:
**Answer 1: Business Question Analysis**
- This comprehensive analysis answers the question of which shipments contain multiple product categories and how late those shipments are, helping identify patterns of delay across different product types.

- Grouping by ['shipID', 'prodCategory'] shows which categories are late within each shipment, while grouping by 'prodCategory' alone reveals overall lateness trends across all shipments.

- Knowing the percentage of multi-category shipments helps ZappTech’s management understand how often complex, mixed-category orders occur — and whether these shipments are more prone to delays — guiding decisions to improve logistics and order processing efficiency.

## 🎯 Method Chaining Philosophy

> "Each operation should build naturally on the previous one"

*Think of method chaining like building with LEGO blocks - each piece connects to the next, creating something more complex and useful than the individual pieces.*

## 💾 Important: Save Your Work Frequently!

**Before you start:** Make sure to commit your work often using the Source Control panel in Cursor (Ctrl+Shift+G or Cmd+Shift+G). This prevents the AI from overwriting your progress and ensures you don't lose your work.

**Commit after each major step:**

- After completing each mental model section
- After adding your visualizations
- After completing your advanced method chain
- Before asking the AI for help with new code

**How to commit:**

1. Open Source Control panel (Ctrl+Shift+G)
2. Stage your changes (+ button)
3. Write a descriptive commit message
4. Click the checkmark to commit

*Remember: Frequent commits are your safety net!*
